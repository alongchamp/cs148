            Question: What does the debug if statement tell us?
        </h1>
        <p>
            The debug statement shows the person who uses it what the array holds, this means
            any of the data that is in it. This helps the user find errors because if there 
            is nothing that shows up on the site and the array is empty when debug is on 
            then there is an error either gathering data or in the code to set it in the 
            array. It also shows the 2D array which means its an associative array which 
            shows you where specifically in the array the values are and where you can 
            call them from.
